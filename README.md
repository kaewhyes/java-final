## Our Idea:
Create a password generator that can make simple and complex passwords

## Goals:
- [ ] Get user input to ask how many characters in their password, what type of password, and the number of passwords
    - [ ] How many characters
    - [ ] Type of password
    - [ ] Number of passwords
- [ ] Generate Simple passwords 
    - [ ] Use an array with random words, and select them using a random number
- [ ] Generate complex passwords
    - [ ] Use substrings to choose randomly from `CHARS`,`SPECIAL_CHARS` and `NUMBERS`.
      - [ ] Concatonate these random characters together to make a password
